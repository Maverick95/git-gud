Would be good to come up with some example jobs to do with shell scripts.

Count the number of solution files .sln within a folder,
and list them.
Should be easy enough.
Need to write a (recursive) function that checks the number of .sln files in a folder.
If they encounter a folder, then recurse on this folder.
So need to look up functions first of all.
Should be easy enough.
Problem with your approach is, there is probably a much simpler way.
Are there any better sources for learning about shell script basics?


Script ideas -

a) a script that checks and syncs your local GIT repository with a remote one,
this ensures that if there is a repo that say you hardly use, but other people
commit to it, yours stays up to date.

What are awk and sed?

You have access to the UNIX command "make",
looking into makefiles might be interesting.

Enough rubbish, I want to write a proper script.

Okay, so there are probably some ways of doing this.
But it involves you dealing with the header file first, and then each subsequent line.
And I'm not sure if the UNIX operations can really help you.

Can you have pipes that include your own functions / processses / scripts?
