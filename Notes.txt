Would be good to come up with some example jobs to do with shell scripts.

Count the number of solution files .sln within a folder,
and list them.
Should be easy enough.
Need to write a (recursive) function that checks the number of .sln files in a folder.
If they encounter a folder, then recurse on this folder.
So need to look up functions first of all.
Should be easy enough.
Problem with your approach is, there is probably a much simpler way.
Are there any better sources for learning about shell script basics?


Script ideas -

a) a script that checks and syncs your local GIT repository with a remote one,
this ensures that if there is a repo that say you hardly use, but other people
commit to it, yours stays up to date.
