Would be good to come up with some example jobs to do with shell scripts.

Count the number of solution files .sln within a folder,
and list them.

Should be easy enough.

Need to write a (recursive) function that checks the number of .sln files in a folder.

If they encounter a folder, then recurse on this folder.

So need to look up functions first of all.

Should be easy enough.
